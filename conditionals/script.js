Conditionals Practice Problems*/

// 1. Check Your Math
// Use JavaScript to check and see if the following comparisons are true. For each of the following, log "True fact!" to the console if the condition evaluates to true and "LIES!" to the console if it doesn't.

// Is the sum of 1 and 1 greater than 5?
if (1+1 > 5) {
    console.log("True fact!");
} else {
    console.log("LIES!");
}
// Is the product of 4 and 5 less than or equal to 20?
if (4+5 <= 20) {
    console.log("True fact!");
} else {
    console.log("LIES!");
}
// Is the difference between 6 and 2 greater than or equal to 0?
if (6-2 >= 0) {
    console.log("True fact!");
} else {
    console.log("LIES!");
}
